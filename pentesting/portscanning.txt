===== Passive Information Gathering =====

    What domain did you investigate?
    > carleton.edu
    What is its IP address?
    > 137.22.94.36
    When does the domain's registration expire?
    > 31 July 2024
    What information, if any, did you learn about the people or corporation
    responsible for the domain in question?
    (Your answer could be less interesting than you had hoped due to the
    increasingly common use of domain privacy services. In that case, at
    least give me information about what you learned about the relevant
    domain privacy service.)

===== Host Detection =====

> IP Addresses of Active Hosts on 192.168.182.128/24
	192.168.182.128 (Kali)
	192.168.182.2 another host on the machine with Host ID 2	
	192.168.182.129 (Metasploitable)

> nmap broadcasts "Who has 192.168.182.*? Tell 192.168.182.128" once per ID address
  If the host is active, the response is "192.168.182.* is at [MAC address]"


> IP Addresses of Active Hosts on 137.22.4.0/24
	137.22.4.5 (elegit.mathcs.carleton.edu)
	137.22.4.17 (perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu)
	137.22.4.131 (maize.mathcs.carleton.edu)

> TCP handshake between the two hosts initiated by Kali. In the case of maize.mathcs.carleton.edu, TCP with both ports 443 and 80. The handshake ended with TCP RST from Kali.

> RSA SSH host key: 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3
  Purpose: Used to verify that the computer attempting to access is the computer it says it is AND is   
  authorized to access this server.

> Telnet, Port #23. Allows the user to write on a command line and ultimately gain access of a remote machine.
